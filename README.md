# Simplified Vue 3 Virtual DOM
This is an example showing how a virtual DOM could be implemented. This is not a complete implementation for a VDOM, rather than an example for **educational purposes**.

The [vue-vdom.js](vue-vdom.js) has a very simplified implementation of the `patch` function to keep the example simple.

[vue-vdom-extended.js](vue-vdom-extended.js) has a bit more elaborate algorithm.

In the file [vdom-examples.js](vdom-examples.js) are various different examples of render functions.
